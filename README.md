# LaserTurret
🧠 Face-Tracking Laser Turret

A fully automated laser turret powered by computer vision and custom hardware.

🧩 Custom CAD-modeled parts for precise mechanical movement

⚙️ Arduino-controlled servo system for smooth laser positioning

🤖 YOLOv11-XL custom-trained on a 10K+ image dataset for accurate face detection

🐍 Python + OpenCV pipeline relays real-time bounding box coordinates to servos

🔴 Laser dynamically tracks detected faces with minimal latency

Built for experimentation in AI-driven mechatronics and real-time object tracking.
